    <h1>10. Return the number of vowels in a string</h1>
    <p>Create a function that’ll return an integer of the number of vowels found in a string. This is a great way to
        practice determining the features of a dataset. If you use JavaScript later in your career, you’ll be
        well-prepared to determine what datasets (or just strings) consist of. If you feel like an extra challenge,
        consider returning the number of characters.</p>
