    <h1>2. Print a table containing multiplication tables.</h1>
    <p>Letâ€™s start with the tables that many of us had to memorize in school. Can you print a table that contains all
        the answers to the multiplication tables from 1 through 10?

        Like Challenge #1, can you create an efficient solution that you could easily expand should you need the 12
        times table?
