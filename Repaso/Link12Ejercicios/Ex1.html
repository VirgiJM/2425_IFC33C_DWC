    <h1>1. Print all even numbers from 0 â€“ 10.</h1>
    <p>Try to make the solution to this problem as efficiently as possible. Consider using loops that would allow you to
        type the fewest characters/commands. While you could simply print the even numbers, get creative and see how you
        could output them in a way that would work up to 10 or even up to 10,000 with little extra effort.</p>
