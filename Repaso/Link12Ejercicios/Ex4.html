    <h1>4. Calculate the sum of numbers within an array</h1>
    <p>You can create your own array of numbers but consider trying this problem with a few different sets to verify
        your solution. Have one array with negative and positive numbers and another with integers and decimals.

        You could also try using arrays of different lengths. If youâ€™re feeling comfortable with this, try the slightly
        more challenging bonus challenge below.

        Bonus intermediate challenge: Create a function that can return the sum of a particular column or row number in
        a table.</p>
