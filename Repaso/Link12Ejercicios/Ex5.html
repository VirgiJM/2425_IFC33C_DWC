    <h1>5. Create a function that reverses an array</h1>
    <p>This challenge is particularly helpful if you’re planning to become a Data Scientist. Manipulating data is a
        significant part of the role, and building the foundations now will help you later down the road when you’re
        working with large databases.

        Start small here and work your way up. Begin with an array of 5 numbers, and then try your program with a larger
        array to verify its success.</p>
