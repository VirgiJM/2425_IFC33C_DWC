    <h1>3. Create a length converter function</h1>
    <p>Creating a function is a skill that’ll be useful in many settings, and as you progress, you’ll be working on much
        more complicated functions than this one. But a function that converts units of measure can be pretty handy in
        multiple professions and industries.

        Let’s start with a conversion from kilometers to miles. The function should include the input in kilometers and
        return the answer in miles.</p>
